<h1>Simple Inventory Management System</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Welcome to the Simple Inventory Management System project! This Python-based project is designed to help manage an inventory through a straightforward and intuitive interface. Each inventory item is stored as a dictionary containing the item's name, quantity and a brief description. These dictionaries are then collected into a master inventory list, making it easy to add, update, display, and remove items as needed.
<br />


<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>Item Management: Create a dictionary for each item with a name, quantity, and description.<br /> 
- <b>Master Inventory List: A comprehensive list that stores all item dictionaries.</b>
- <b>Add Items: Functionality to add new items to the inventory list, expanding your inventory.</b>
- <b>Display Inventory: A neatly formatted display of the inventory, providing clear insights into each item's details.</b>
- <b>Update Quantity: Ability to change the quantity of any given item, accommodating stock increases or decreases.</b>
- <b>Remove Items: Option to remove items from the inventory, keeping your list accurate and up-to-date.
</b>
